# -Distributed-Job-Scheduler-like-AWS-Batch-Celery-Airflow-lite

### Tech Stack:
	-	Go or Java, gRPC/REST, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes
	-	Kafka for job/event queue
	-	Optional: React dashboard

### 📌 Features:
	- Create, schedule, and retry background jobs (e.g., image resize, email)
	- Retry with exponential backoff
	-	Worker pools (scalable consumers)
	-	Job status: Pending, Running, Failed, Succeeded
	-	Time-based scheduling (like cron jobs)

### 💼 Skills Demonstrated:
	-	Distributed worker queues
	-	Idempotent job design
	-	Event-driven architecture (Kafka/Redis)
	-	Scalable backend design + job orchestration
